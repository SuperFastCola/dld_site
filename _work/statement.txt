Large beasts rule the world piloted by grubs. These grubs are translucent but some are opaque. The opaques are found to be inferior by the translucents, so they live in the lower sections of log town writhing in droppings all the while catering to the whims of the translucents. The translucnets tell everyone they worked hard to get what they have. Opaque frustration builds up every few years and the translucents call in the beetles to tear the opaques to bits and push them back down to the lowers.


The world is a awash with consumerism and mind-control. An extremely seductive washing clouds most minds but let’s forget I said that and agree to disagree. We have the prettiest house in the land but don’t scratch the clap boards or you will expose the rot. These pictures reprsent observations from the last 25 years when I though I was able to see through the fog but it may have only been rocks coming in to sink my boat.
